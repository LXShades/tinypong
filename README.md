# tinypong
Tiny, multiplayer game of Pong where the players are all characters with deep backstories and motivations. Such as the balls, which don't want to die in a goal. And the paddles, which don't want the balls to die in their goal. But do want the balls to die in the other goal. Undue chaos ensues in this one-of-a-kind World War I simulation game fit for an emperor.
